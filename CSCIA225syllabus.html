<b>COURSE DESCRIPTION:</b> This course is an introduction to web development. 
The course will explore prevailing technologies in three main components of web application: client, server, and data.
 It will also provide practical experiences with large-scale interactive website development.
</p>
<p>
<b>PREREQUISITES:&nbsp;</b>
Grade of&nbsp; C or better in CSCI145.
</p>
<p>
<b>TEXTS: </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set by Jon Duckett </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b></p>
&nbsp;This is a one-semester introduction course to web development.
Emphasis will be placed on core technologies such as HTML5, CSS3,
JavaScript, Framework and server side application. Selected topic will be taught and students are
expected to read extensively outside of the class.&nbsp; At the end of
the class, students will
<ul>
  <li>have a fundamental knowledge of how fully functional websites
work. </li>
  <li>build&nbsp; a solid foundation in web development. </li>
  <li>be able to understand the challenge and limitation of web
programming.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>COURSE ORGANIZATION and POLICY: </b> Course materials are organized
based on weeks. New materials such as lecture notes, walk through
demos, assignments will be posted at the beginning of each week.&nbsp;
Coding is the focus of this course and the best kind of learning is by
doing. My advice to you is to dedicate at least three or four blocks of
time every week to work on this course. You might start with
lecture notes, and then follow the examples afterwards. Once you feel
that you have a good grasp of the contents, you can work on the weekly
assignment. </p>
<p>
CSCI225 is an online course in which practically all of the content and interactions will be accessed through the Blackboard course. 
Online course offerings are expected to be 100% synchronous. Attendance is mandatory. And students are expected to participate
in discussion, work on in-class activities, answer polls. 
<br>
If you have a general course related questions, please always check whether it is already answered in Questions and Answers board. If not, then please post it in the board with detailed information. 
  Email is only reserved for specific questions about grade. Reply times may vary from 24-48 hours but I may answer you sooner if I am available. Any questions after Friday afternoon may have to wait until the following Monday morning.

        will be implemented in this course.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Students must wear a face covering for any face to face meeting of the course throughout the semester. Any
          student that does not wear a face mask upon entering will be asked to leave the classroom in order to
          retrieve a covering before being allowed to return. </li>
        <li>Students who have documented conditions that could be exacerbated by wearing face
          coverings should apply for accommodations with the Student Office of Disability Services.</li>

          education and/or disciplinary action.</li>
        <li>Students should practice social distancing as much as possible.</li>
        <li> Students should practice good hygiene by washing their hands as much as possible, following CDC
          hand-washing protocol. Each student should use his or her own hand sanitizer or the hand sanitizer either
          provided in the classroom or in the hallway outside of the classroom as much as possible.</li>
        <li>If a student becomes sick or feels that he or she is becoming ill, that student should not come to campus.
          The student should immediately notify the course instructor and seek medical assistance/advice from the
          UofSC Aiken Student Health Center by calling 803-641-2840.</li>

    </li>
    <li><b>Computer and Communication </b> <p>
      <ul>

    <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Class attendance is required. It is
          highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
          make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
          absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
          will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
          situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
          holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
          late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Blackboard is down: </b> Please attend my Zoom personal meeting to continue the live lecture.
        </li>
        <li><b>No access to internet - students:</b> You will need access to a reliable computer with high-speed internet access.
          Occasionally you will be excused from random poor internet connection. Please let the instructor aware that you 
          can not attend the class due to poor internet connection. You are expected to watch class video and finish the in-class work.
        </li>
        <li><b>No access to internet - instructor:</b> You will receive an message from the instructor if this happens. The instructor will post lectures/activities on line and 
          please do check and finish it.  The class will not be cancelled.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
</li>

    <li><b> Special Circumstance  </b> <p>If you have a physical,
      psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
      performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
      Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
      Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
      based on documentation.</p> </li>
    <li><b> Academic Integrity </b> <p>Please read and review the
      Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
        href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
        Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
      If you are found to be
      in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
      the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
      and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
      collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
      certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
      program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
      his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
      doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
      not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
      Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b> <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
      the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
      classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
      causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
      for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b><p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
      phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
      disturb the class. </p></li>
