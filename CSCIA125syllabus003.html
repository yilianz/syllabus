      <b> COURSE DELIVERY &amp; ORGANIZATION: </b>
      CSCI125 is a hybrid course in which practically all of the content and interactions will be accessed through the Blackboard course. 
      Online course offerings are expected to be 100% synchronous. Attendance is mandatory. And students are expected to participate
      in discussion, work on in-class activities, answer polls. Please check the tentative schedule for FACE-to-FACE meeting time. 
    <br>
      If you have a general course related questions, please always check whether it is already answered in Questions and Answers board. If not, then please post it in the board with detailed information. 
        Email is only reserved for specific questions. Reply times may vary from 24-48 hours but I may answer you sooner if I am available. Any questions after Friday afternoon may have to wait until the following Monday morning. 
    <br>
    </p>
   
    <p><b>Homework and Late Homework Policy</b>: Assignments will be posted
      on blackboard. No late work
      will be accepted, however the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Both written exercises and code exercises
      are included.  <br>
      <i>How to submit assignment and in-class work:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>You may zip your homework files and upload to blackboard. </li>
        <li>Or you may host all your homework files on GitHub/Google drive/Other cloud drives, 
          and then put the shared links in blackboard. If you prefer a private github repository to host 
          all programming files, please add @yilianz as collaborator. </li>

      </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Midterms:</b> There will be three midterm tests. Grades are not
      curved. Extensions and makeup exams will only be given in documented cases of serious
      illness or other emergencies.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Final Project:</b> Student will form into a small team with two or three members. 
      The team members will pick a project that fit their interest. Final project presentation will be held on
      December 07,2020&nbsp; from 2:00pm-5:00pm &nbsp; in the
      same room the class has met all semester. </p>

    <p>
      <b> Participation:</b> This portion of grade will be based on your consistent
      attendance at the lectures and lab sessions, and on your participation in the activities for
      each class. You will be
      graded on your participation, not on the correctness of your answers. <br>

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Class attendance is required. It is
            highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
            make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
            absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
            will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
            situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
            holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
            late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Blackboard is down: </b> Please attend my Zoom personal meeting to continue the live lecture.
          </li>
          <li><b>No access to internet - students:</b> You will need access to a reliable computer with high-speed internet access.
            Occasionally you will be excused from random poor internet connection. Please let the instructor aware that you 
            can not attend the class due to poor internet connection. You are expected to watch class video and finish the in-class work.
          </li>
          <li><b>No access to internet - instructor:</b> You will receive an message from the instructor if this happens. The instructor will post lectures/activities on line and 
            please do check and finish it.  The class will not be cancelled.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
 </li>

      <li><b> Special Circumstance  </b> <p>If you have a physical,
        psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
        performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
        Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
        Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
        based on documentation.</p> </li>
      <li><b> Academic Integrity </b> <p>Please read and review the
        Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
          href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
          Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
        If you are found to be
        in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
        the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
        and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
        collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
        certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
        program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
        his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
        doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
        not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
        Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b> <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
        the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
        classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
        causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
        for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b><p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
        phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
        disturb the class. </p></li>
