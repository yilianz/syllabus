    <ol>
      <li><b>Face-covering and Hygiene Requirements</b>
        <p>
          In an effort to maintain the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff, the following requirements
          will be implemented in this course.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Students must wear a face covering for any face to face meeting of the course throughout the semester. Any
            student that does not wear a face mask upon entering will be asked to leave the classroom in order to
            retrieve a covering before being allowed to return. </li>
          <li>Students who have documented conditions that could be exacerbated by wearing face coverings should apply
            to become registered with the Student Office of Disability Services. Students who become registered with the
            SDRC will be entitled to reasonable accommodations.</li>
          <li> Any student who violates a face-covering mandate may be referred to the Office for Student Life for
            education and/or disciplinary action.</li>
          <li>Students should practice social distancing as much as possible.</li>
          <li> Students should practice good hygiene by washing their hands as much as possible, following CDC
            hand-washing protocol. Each student should use his or her own hand sanitizer or the hand sanitizer either
            provided in the classroom or in the hallway outside of the classroom as much as possible.</li>
          <li>If a student becomes sick or feels that he or she is becoming ill, that student should not come to campus.
            The student should immediately notify the course instructor and seek medical assistance/advice from the
            UofSC Aiken Student Health Center by calling 803-641-2840.</li>

      <li><b>Computer and Communication </b>
        <ul>
          <li>Each student must have regular access to a computer with a video camera and microphone; these may be
            required daily or only on occasion depending on mode of instruction or health status of student or faculty.
          </li>
          <li>
            All students must be able to access and use Blackboard.

      <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Class attendance is required. It is
            highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
            make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
            absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
            will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
            situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
            holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
            late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Blackboard is down: </b> Please attend my Zoom personal meeting to continue the live lecture.
          </li>
          <li><b>No access to internet - students:</b> You will need access to a reliable computer with high-speed internet access.
            Occasionally you will be excused from random poor internet connection. Please let the instructor aware that you 
            can not attend the class due to poor internet connection. You are expected to watch class video and finish the in-class work.
          </li>
          <li><b>No access to internet - instructor:</b> You will receive an message from the instructor if this happens. The instructor will post lectures/activities on line and 
            please do check and finish it.  The class will not be cancelled.
          </li>
        </ul>
 </li>
      <li><b> Special Circumstance </b> If you have a physical,
        psychological, and/or learning disability which might affect your
        performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
        Services, 126A B&amp;E, (803) 641-3609, as soon as possible. The
        Disability Services Office will determine appropriate accommodations
        based on medical documentation. </li>
      <li><b> Academic Integrity   </b> Please read and review the
        Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
          href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
          Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
        If you are found to be
        in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
        the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
        and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
        collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
        certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
        program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
        his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
        doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
        not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
         Don't even take the risk.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>USCA Code of Conduct   </b> Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
        the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
        classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
        causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
        for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.
