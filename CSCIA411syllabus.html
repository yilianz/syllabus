    <ul>
      <li>You may zip your homework files and upload to blackboard. </li>
      <li>Or you may host all your homework files on GitHub, 
        and then put the shared links in blackboard. If you prefer a private github repository to host 
        all your files, please add @yilianz as collaborator of the repository. </li>

    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p><i>Late Homework Policy</i>: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late

      your
      responsibility to submit homework assignment on time. </p>
    <p>
      <b> Major tests:</b> There will be two tests given
      throughout the semester. Each test will be approximately 75
      minutes in length. Please check the tentative schedule for test dates.
      If you miss the test and present a valid excuse within
      one week after the test date, MAKE-UP on tests
      will be given. </p>
    <p>
      <b> Presentation:</b> You will be asked to read a recent research paper on
      operating systems, present the major findings of paper and answer questions. 
      The presentation could be a group presentation with at most three members. Presentation is
      scheduled on December 8, 2022,from 2:00-5:00pm in the classroom. </p>

          </li>

          <li> If you have some specific questions about your grade/attendance/etc, please email me.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Class attendance is required. It is
            highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
            make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
            absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
            will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
            situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
            holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
            late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
          </li>

        </ul>
 </li>
      <li><b> Special Circumstance </b> If you have a physical,
        psychological, and/or learning disability which might affect your
        performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
        Services, 126A B&amp;E, (803) 641-3609, as soon as possible. The
        Disability Services Office will determine appropriate accommodations
        based on medical documentation. </li>
      <li><b> Academic Integrity   </b> Please read and review the
        Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
          href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
          Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
        If you are found to be
        in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
        the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
        and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
        collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
        certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
        program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
        his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
        doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
        not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
         Don't even take the risk.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>USCA Code of Conduct   </b> Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
        the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
        classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
        causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
        for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.
