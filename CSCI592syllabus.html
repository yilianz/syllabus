                      Class attendance is required. It is
                      highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
                      make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
                      absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
                      will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related
                      situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
                      holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
                      late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.

                  <p>If you have a physical, psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect
                    your performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability Services
                    located in the Educational Support Building Suite 104, phone number is 803-643-6815.
                    The Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations

                <li><b> Academic Integrity </b>
                  <p>Please read and review the
                    Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
                      href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
                      Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
                    If you are found to be
                    in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
                    the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
                    and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
                    collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
                    certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
                    program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
                    his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
                    doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
                    not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs.
                    Don't even take the risk.</p><br>

                    classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been
                    ejected
                    causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
                    for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>

                  <p>
                    Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that prohibits
                    discrimination on the basis of sex of students and employees of educational
                    institutions that receive federal financial assistance.
                    USC Aiken does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its educational
                    programs and in other activities operated by the University and is required by
                    Title IX, and specifically 34 C.F.R. § 106.11, not to discriminate in such a manner.
                    This extends to current students, current employees, and applicants for
                    employment or admission to the University.
                    If you or someone you know has experienced sex discrimination,
                    sexual violence and/or harassment by any member of the University community,
                    you are encouraged to report the conduct to USC Aiken's Coordinator of Title IX & Civil Rights
                    at (803) 641-3442. Additional resources are available at https://www.usca.edu/title-ix/.
