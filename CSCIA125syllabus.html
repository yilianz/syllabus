      <b> COURSE DELIVERY &amp; ORGANIZATION: </b>
      CSCI125 is a technology-based course in which practically all of the content and interactions will be accessed
      through the Blackboard course.
      Attendance is mandatory. And students are expected to log into blackboard, participate
      in discussion, work on in-class exercises, answer online polls.
      <br>
      If you have a general course related questions, please always check whether it is already answered in Questions
      and Answers board. If not, then please post it in the board with detailed information.
      Email is only reserved for specific questions. Reply times may vary from 24-48 hours but I may answer you sooner
      if I am available. Any questions after Friday afternoon may have to wait until the following Monday morning.
      <br>
    </p>

    <p><b>Homework and Late Homework Policy</b>: Assignments will be posted
      on blackboard. No late work
      will be accepted, however the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Both written exercises and code exercises
      are included. <br>
      <i>How to submit assignment and in-class work:</i>
    <ul>
      <li>You may host all your homework files on GitHub/Google drive/Other cloud drives,
        and then put the shared links in blackboard. If you prefer a private github repository to host
        all programming files, please add @yilianz as collaborator. </li>

    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Midterms:</b> There will be three midterm tests. Grades are not
      curved. Extensions and makeup exams will only be given in documented cases of serious
      illness or other emergencies.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Final Project:</b> Student will form into a small team with two or three members.
      The team members will pick a project that fits their interest. Final project presentation will be held on
      December 8, 2022&nbsp; from 11:00pm-2:00pm &nbsp;.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Participation:</b> This portion of grade will be based on your consistent
      attendance at the lectures and lab sessions, and on your participation in the activities for
      each class. You will be
      graded on your participation, not on the correctness of your answers. <br>
    </p>

            required to provide a note from a medical professional or our COVID Coordinators. Students are still
            responsible for the course material covered. Faculty will establish course-specific practices to assist
            students but are not required to provide a video recording of the course or to allow students to join class
            remotely.

          </li>
          <li> Additional health guidance will be shared during the course of the semester should conditions require it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>


      <li><b>Computer and Communication </b>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each student must have regular access to a computer with a video camera and microphone; these may be
            required daily or only on occasion depending on mode of instruction or health status of student or faculty.
          </li>
          <li>
            All students must be able to access and use Blackboard.

            <br>

          </li>

          <li> If you have some specific questions about your grade/attendance/etc, please email me.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><b> Attendance Policy </b>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Class attendance is required. It is
            highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
            make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
            absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
            will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related
            situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
            holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
            late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><b> Special Circumstance </b>
        <p>If you have a physical,
          psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
          performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
          Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
          Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
          based on documentation.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b> Academic Integrity </b>
        <p>Please read and review the
          Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
            href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
            Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
          If you are found to be
          in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
          the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
          and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
          collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
          certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
          program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
          his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
          doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
          not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs.
          Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b>
        <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
          the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
          classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been
          ejected
          causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
          for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b>
        <p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
          phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
          disturb the class. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
