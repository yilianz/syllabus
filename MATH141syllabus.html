<p>
<b> COURSE ORGANIZATION &amp; TOPICS TO BE COVERED: </b>
This course is not a traditional mathematical course. Each lecture will
be divided into two sections: the instructor's lecture, and the
student's exploration and discussion. <br>
Topics include limit, continuity, derivative,
applications of the derivative,  integrals,
fundamental theorem of calculus. <br>

<p>
<b> Homework:</b> Written exercises will place emphasis on basic techniques. These
problems must be worked and turned in
individually. You should use <b> clear and coherent argument </b> and <b>
correct mathematical notation and terminology </b> to write your
homework. <br>
Lab assignments will be done individually or in group. The class will be divided into
two-person teams.Generally each team member will get same grade, but it is possible that
a team member who does not do his work may get a lower grade.
Suggestion: It is highly recommended that all team members do the
homework together. <br>
Short homework quizzes will be given every week and pop up conceptual quiz will be given frequently. <br>
Special requirement for Lab assignments: Assignment is submitted
in a Maple notebook style. You need to upload your lab assignment to K:/Zhang/TurnInYourLabHere drive.<br>
</p>
<p><i>Late Homework Policy</i>: <span style="font-weight: bold;">No
late lab assignment will be
accepted.</span>  Each student has one-week extension on written
homework
throughout the semester. <span style="font-weight: bold;">No late work
will be accepted after you use out
your one-week extension.</span> </p>
<p>
<b> Major tests:</b> There will be two literacy tests given
throughout
the semester. The written part of each test will be approximately 75
minutes in length. Use of Maple and calculator is not allowed in the
written
part of the test. The computer part of each test will be
approximately 30
minutes in length. Please check the tentative schedule for test dates.
NO
MAKE-UP on tests
will be given. If you miss the test and present a valid excuse within
one week after the test date, final exam grade will replace that test
grade.  Final exam grade  might also be used by other
students to replace the lowest
test grade if needed. </p>
<p>
<b> FINAL EXAM:</b> Final exam is on Wednesday, April 27, 2022  from
5:00pm-8:00pm, in the same room the class has met all semester. The
final exam
is a cumulative exam and will cover all of the material covered in
class. 
<p>
  <p>
    <b> Participation:</b> This portion of grade will be based on your consistent
    attendance at the lectures and lab sessions, and on your participation in the activities for
    each class. You will be
    graded on your participation, not on the correctness of your answers. <br>
  </p>

            hand-washing protocol. Each student should use his or her own hand sanitizer or the hand sanitizer either
            provided in the classroom or in the hallway outside of the classroom as much as possible.</li>
          <li>If a student becomes sick or feels that he or she is becoming ill, that student should not come to campus.
            The student should immediately notify the course instructor and seek medical assistance/advice from the
            UofSC Aiken Student Health Center by calling 803-641-2840.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
  
    <li><b>Computer and Communication </b> <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each student must have regular access to a computer with a video camera and microphone; these may be
          required daily or only on occasion depending on mode of instruction or health status of student or faculty.
        </li>
        <li>
          All students must be able to access and use Blackboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each student must have internet access to receive notifications about the class and to complete assignments,
          if required by the instructor.
        </li>
        <li>Students must check their university email and Blackboard announcements each day.</li>

      </ul>

      </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Mode of instruction </b> <p>
      The University of South Carolina Aiken reserves the right to change, adjust, and/or cancel any
      campus operation, including but not limited to, mode of instruction, delivery of services, or use
      of campus facilities, whenever the campus administration determines in its sole discretion that
      circumstances warrant the operational change.</p></li>
    
    <li><b> Get Help</b><p>
      <ul>
        <li>Please drop by my office hour if you are on campus. </li>
        <li> If you'd like to meet me virtually to ask a question, please drop in my virtual office hour or make an
          appointment on Wednesday. <br>
          You may go to https://zoom.us/join directly and enter the Meeting ID(299 727 0983) and Passcode(647186).
         <br>
        </li>

        <li> If you have some specific questions about your grade/attendance/etc, please email me.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Class attendance is required. It is
          highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
          make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
          absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
          will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
          situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
          holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.  Arriving
          late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence. **student who gets placed in isolation or quarantine
          will be able to provide documentation from USCA Covid Coordinators.**
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      </p>
</li>

    <li><b> Special Circumstance  </b> <p>If you have a physical,
      psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
      performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
      Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
      Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
      based on documentation.</p> </li>
    <li><b> Academic Integrity </b> <p>Please read and review the
      Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
        href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
        Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
      If you are found to be
      in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
      the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
      and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
      collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
      certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
      program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
      his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
      doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
      not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
      Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b> <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
      the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
      classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
      causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
      for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b><p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
      phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
      disturb the class. </p></li>
