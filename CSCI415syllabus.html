<p>
<b> NOTES: </b>
</p>

<ol>
  
  <li><b> USCA Code of Conduct.</b> Students will conduct
themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in the USCA
Student Handbook.</li>
 
 <li><b> Attendance Policy: </b>Class attendance is required. It is
highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
may be granted for documented incapacitating illness, official
representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence. </li>

  <li><b> Special Circumstance: </b> If you have a physical, psychological, 
      and/or learning disability that might affect your performance in this class,
      please contact the Office of Disability Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible.
      The Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations based on documentation. </li>

  <li><b> Academic Integrity:</b> Please read and review the
Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in USC
Aiken Student Handbook. 
If you are found to be
in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even a draft of your
program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. <br>
  </li>
  
  <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS:</b> As a courtesy to the class, cell
phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
disturb the class. </li>
