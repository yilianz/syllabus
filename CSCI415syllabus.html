  <b> NOTES: </b>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Face-covering and Hygiene Requirements</b>
    <p>

        retrieve a covering before being allowed to return. </li>
      <li>Students who have documented conditions that could be exacerbated by wearing face
        coverings should apply for accommodations with the Student Office of Disability Services.</li>
      <li> Any student who violates a face-covering mandate may be referred to the Office for Student Life for
        education and/or disciplinary action.</li>
      <li>Students should practice social distancing as much as possible.</li>
      <li> Students should practice good hygiene by washing their hands as much as possible, following CDC
        hand-washing protocol. Each student should use his or her own hand sanitizer or the hand sanitizer either
        provided in the classroom or in the hallway outside of the classroom as much as possible.</li>
      <li>If a student becomes sick or feels that he or she is becoming ill, that student should not come to campus.
        The student should immediately notify the course instructor and seek medical assistance/advice from the
        UofSC Aiken Student Health Center by calling 803-641-2840.</li>
    </ul>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Computer and Communication </b> <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each student must have regular access to a computer with a video camera and microphone; these may be
        required daily or only on occasion depending on mode of instruction or health status of student or faculty.
      </li>

      </li>

      <li> If you have some specific questions about your grade/attendance/etc, please email me.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Class attendance is required. It is
        highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
        make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
        absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
        will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
        situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
        holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
        late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Blackboard is down: </b> Please attend my Zoom personal meeting to continue the live lecture.
      </li>
      <li><b>No access to internet - students:</b> You will need access to a reliable computer with high-speed internet access.
        Occasionally you will be excused from random poor internet connection. Please let the instructor aware that you 
        can not attend the class due to poor internet connection. You are expected to watch class video and finish the in-class work.
      </li>
      <li><b>No access to internet - instructor:</b> You will receive a message from the instructor if this happens. The instructor will post lectures/activities on line and 
        please do check and finish it.  The class will not be cancelled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

  <li><b> Special Circumstance  </b> <p>If you have a physical,
    psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
    performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
    Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
    Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
    based on documentation.</p> </li>
  <li><b> Academic Integrity </b> <p>Please read and review the
    Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
      href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
      Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
    If you are found to be
    in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
    the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
    and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
    collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
    certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
    program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
    his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
    doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
    not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
    Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b> <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
    the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
    classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
    causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
    for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b><p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
    phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
    disturb the class. </p></li>
