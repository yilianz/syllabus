<p>
<b><b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b></b></p>
 This is a one-semester introductory course on computer networking.  The goal of this course is breadth, not depth to cover the subjects.  Only selected topics will be taught and students are expected to read extensively outside of the class.  
This course is a foundation course for students who are looking for a career path in IT support and network administrator.  Writing communication, especially technical writing is essential in the professional working environment.  
At the end of the class, students will
<ul>

  <li>have a fundamental knowledge of how computer network and internet operate. <br>
    </li>

  <li> have a good understanding of network layers and common network protocols, such as TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP and etc. <br>
    </li>

  <li> be able to develop simple, yet practical network applications. </li>
  <li> be able to troubleshoot networking problems and present the solutions clearly. </li>

</ul>

<p><b> Homework and Quiz:</b> Assignments consist of written problems from the book, problem-solution essays, and programming exercises. Some of the assignments will involve group work. 
Most essay assignments ask you to analyze a network problem and propose a detailed troubleshooting guide. 
  Criteria in grading: a. Whether your answer is correct? b. Whether your answer is clear and understandable? Typed homework is recommended.
Simple homework quiz might be given occasionally. The lowest score of quizzes will be dropped.
There is no makeup for quizzes.
</p>
<p><i>Late Homework Policy</i>:<b> Late less than 2 days: 10% off, late more than 2 days: 50% off, late more than a week: grade zero.</b> If you miss the class, it is your responsibility to submit homework assignment on time.

<p>
<b> Major tests:</b>There will be two tests given throughout the semester.
 MAKE-UP on tests will only be given if you miss the test and present a valid excuse within one week after the test date. <br>
</p>

<p>
<b> Participation: </b> The grade of participation will be based on
the attendance and in-class discussion.
</p>
<p>
<b> FINAL Project:</b> The purpose of this assignment is to develop practical network applications that are based on various networking protocol. You and your group partner will present the final product and submit a report on networking protocol used. Final project report is due on 11:00am Monday, May 2,
2022. Presentation will be held from 11:00-2:00pm Monday, May 2,
2022, in the same room the

      <li>According to university policy stated on August 18, 2021, facial coverings are required in classrooms and other indoor spaces where social distancing is not possible. </li>
      <li>Students should practice social distancing as much as possible.</li>
      <li> Students should practice good hygiene by washing their hands as much as possible, following CDC

        provided in the classroom or in the hallway outside of the classroom as much as possible.</li>
      <li>If a student becomes sick or feels that he or she is becoming ill, that student should not come to campus.
        The student should immediately notify the course instructor and seek medical assistance/advice from the
        UofSC Aiken Student Health Center by calling 803-641-2840.</li>
    </ul>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Computer and Communication </b> <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each student must have regular access to a computer with a video camera and microphone; these may be
        required daily or only on occasion depending on mode of instruction or health status of student or faculty.
      </li>
      <li>
        All students must be able to access and use Blackboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each student must have internet access to receive notifications about the class and to complete assignments,
        if required by the instructor.
      </li>
      <li>Students must check their university email and Blackboard announcements each day.</li>

    </ul>

    </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Mode of instruction </b> <p>
    The University of South Carolina Aiken reserves the right to change, adjust, and/or cancel any
    campus operation, including but not limited to, mode of instruction, delivery of services, or use
    of campus facilities, whenever the campus administration determines in its sole discretion that
    circumstances warrant the operational change.</p></li>
  
  <li><b> Get Help</b><p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please drop by my office hour if you are on campus. </li>
      <li> If you'd like to meet me virtually to ask a question, please drop in my virtual office hour or make an
        appointment on Wednesday. <br>
        You may go to https://zoom.us/join directly and enter the Meeting ID(299 727 0983) and Passcode(647186).
       <br>

      </li>

      <li> If you have some specific questions about your grade/attendance/etc, please email me.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Class attendance is required. It is
        highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
        make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
        absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
        will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
        situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
        holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
        late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence. **student who gets placed in isolation or quarantine
         will be able to provide documentation from USCA Covid Coordinators.**
      </li>

    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

  <li><b> Special Circumstance  </b> <p>If you have a physical,
    psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
    performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
    Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
    Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
    based on documentation.</p> </li>
  <li><b> Academic Integrity </b> <p>Please read and review the
    Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
      href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
      Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
    If you are found to be
    in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
    the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
    and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
    collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
    certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
    program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
    his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
    doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
    not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
    Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b> <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
    the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
    classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
    causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
    for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b><p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
    phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
    disturb the class. </p></li>
