      <ul>
        <li>Each student must have regular access to a computer with a video camera and microphone; these may be
          required daily or only on occasion depending on mode of instruction or health status of student or faculty.
        </li>
        <li>
          All students must be able to access and use Blackboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each student must have internet access to receive notifications about the class and to complete assignments,
          if required by the instructor.
        </li>
        <li>Students must check their university email and Blackboard announcements each day.</li>

      The University of South Carolina Aiken reserves the right to change, adjust, and/or cancel any
      campus operation, including but not limited to, mode of instruction, delivery of services, or use
      of campus facilities, whenever the campus administration determines in its sole discretion that

        <li>Please drop by my office hour if you are on campus. </li>
        <li> If you'd like to meet me to ask a question, please drop in my office hour or make an
          appointment on Wednesday. <br>
          You may go to https://zoom.us/join directly and enter the Meeting ID(299 727 0983) and Passcode(647186).

    </li>
    <li><b> Attendance Policy </b> 
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Class attendance is required. It is
          highly recommended that you do not miss any class. You cannot readily
          make up the material missed if you are absent. More than 4 unexcused
          absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused absences
          will be granted for documented incapacitating illness, Covid-19 related 
          situation, official representation of the University, death of a close relative, religious
          holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court.&nbsp; Arriving
          late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
</li>

    <li><b> Special Circumstance  </b> <p>If you have a physical,
      psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
      performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
      Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
      Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
      based on documentation.</p> </li>
    <li><b> Academic Integrity </b> <p>Please read and review the
      Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in <a
        href="https://www.usca.edu/student-affairs/handbook">USC
        Aiken Student Handbook </a>.
      If you are found to be
      in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
      the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
      and/or further sanctions may be pursued. To avoid cheating via
      collaboration, do not show any other classmates your code, and
      certainly don't send anyone an electronic copy, even of a draft of your
      program. If a classmate consults you for help after attempting to run
      his or her program, you may assist in determining why his or her code
      doesn't work, but don't write it for them based on your own code. Do
      not lead your classmates into temptation: guard your print-outs. 
      Don't even take the risk.</p><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>USCA Code of Conduct</b> 
      
      <p>Students will conduct themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in
      the USCA Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: It is the instructor's right to remove from the
      classroom any student who disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who has been ejected
      causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class
      for the remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS </b>
      <p> As a courtesy to the class, cell
      phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
      disturb the class. </p></li>
